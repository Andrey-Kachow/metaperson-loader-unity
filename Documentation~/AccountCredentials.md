## Account Credentials
To export models from the [MetaPerson Creator](https://metaperson.avatarsdk.com/), you'll need AvatarSDK developer account credentials. Follow these steps to obtain them:

1. **Create an AvatarSDK Developer Account.**
   Visit the [AvatarSDK Developer Signup page](https://accounts.avatarsdk.com/developer/signup/) to create your AvatarSDK developer account. If you already have an account, you can skip this step.

2. **Create an Application.**
   After successfully registering or logging in to your AvatarSDK developer account, go to the [Developer Dashboard](https://accounts.avatarsdk.com/developer/). Here, create a new application. 

3. **Retrieve Your App Client ID and App Client Secret.**
   Once your application is created, you can obtain your **App Client ID** and **App Client Secret** from the Developer Dashboard.
